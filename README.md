# Arduino - MeArm Robotic Arm

## Overview

This repository includes all methods and procedures undertaken to design and develop an Arduino controlled Robotic Arm Kit using the MeArm product. This will involve both software
and hardware development. The Robotic Arm should be able to move in the respective directions:
  - Move forwards
  - Move backwards
  - Rotate left
  - Rotate right
  - Gripper Claw Open
  - Gripper Claw Close

For project progression, we are aiming to be able to control the meArm manually using 2 x Sprakfun joysticks. *(Optional)* Bonus Point if we can control the Robotic Arm remotely through Wi-Fi or BLE​

## Equipment

Hardware:

  * Control Board Arduino UNO rev3 (with external 6V/2A power source)
  * Robotic Arm – MeArm Robotic Arm Kit complete with 4 x servos
  * *(Optional)* – ESP8266 Wi-Fi Shield OR HC-04 BLE Module Shield
  * *(Optional)* – Sparkfun joysticks for manual operation
  * Breadboard

## Prerequisites
  * Visual Studio Code
  * Platformio VSCode Extension
  * Arduino IDE
