# Arduino - MeArm Robotic Arm

## Overview

This repository includes all methods and procedures undertaken to design and develop an Arduino controlled Robotic Arm Kit using the MeArm product. This will involve both software
and hardware development. The Robotic Arm should be able to move in the respective directions:
  - Move forwards
  - Move backwards
  - Rotate left
  - Rotate right
  - Gripper Claw Open
  - Gripper Claw Close

*(Optional)* Bonus Point if we can control the Robotic Arm remotely through Wi-Fi or BLEâ€‹
