# Arduino Robotic Arm With Meccanum Wheel

## Overview

This repository includes the methods and procedures undertaken to design and develop an Arduino controlled Robot Kit with Mecanum Wheel. This involves both software
and hardware development. The Robot Kit should be able to:
  - Move forwards
  - Move backwards
  - Turn left
  - Turn right
  - Move left
  - Move right

Also aiming to remotely control the Robot Kit through WiFi using ESP8266 shield module for headless operation using a GUI.

## Equipment

* Arduino UNO Rev3
* MeArm Robotic Arm (Arduino Compatible)
* *(Optional)* ESP8266 Wi-Fi Shield

## Prerequisites
