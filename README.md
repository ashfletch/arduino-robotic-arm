# arduino-robotic-arm

This repository includes the methods and procedures undertaken to design and develop an Arduino controlled Robot Kit with Mecanum Wheel. This involves both software
and hardware development. The Robot Kit should be able to move forward, move backward, turn left, turn right, as well as move sideways to the left and right.

Also aiming to remotely control the Robot Kit through WiFi using ESP8266 shield module for headless operaiton using a GUI.
